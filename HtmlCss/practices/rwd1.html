            <h1>Fixed Layout</h1>
            <p>
                Also known as a .container layout. Fixed
                layout has specific pixel width values
                that change its width value with the help
                of media queries. It provides a responsive
                fixed width container. Fixed layout resizes
                in chunks at several certain widths so
                that's why its called as “fixed width”
                because pixels values are specified.

            <h1>Fluid Layout</h1>
            <p>
                Also known as the .container-fluid
                layout. This layout uses proportional
                values such as measuring unit for a
                block of content, images or any other
                item. Used for creating an element that
                is 100 % wider and covers all the screen
                width. Fluid layout continuously resizes
                as you change the width of your browser
                by any amount, leaving no extra empty
                space on the sides ever Hence it is named
                as “fluid layout”.
